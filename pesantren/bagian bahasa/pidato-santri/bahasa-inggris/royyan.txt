Peace be upon you, and Allah's mercy and blessings.

Alhamdulillah, I can give a speech in front of you.

Now, I want to make a speech about life.

What is life for?

For fun?

To spend treasure?

To pass the time?

To do everything we don't intend to do?

Please answer...

(waiting for reply)

Our goal in this life is to die. How come?

Because everything we do in this world will be held accountable. Starting from us worshiping, playing with friends, playing games, playing ball, playing anything, all of that will be held accountable. In fact, even our silence, our lying on the bed, our planning, the way we live life, the way we eat, the way we take care of our health, will all be held accountable. The more we do good, the more we will be rewarded. The more we do bad, the more we sin. So, which one will we choose?

That's it. Wassalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh.
